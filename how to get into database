#how to get into mysql
mysql -u root -p
# enter password here
# you have now entered your mysql database, you can now use operations
# useful commands:
CREATE DATABASE DB_NAME;   #dont forget to use the ";" after the operation

use DB_NAME;   #enter your created database to do stuff

create table TABLE_NAME (ENTRY_NAME char(255));    #it is possible to add multiple entries inside your table, just add a comma

DESCRIBE TABLE_NAME         #this will show the table with the entries you just made with all keys

#show tables;    #this will show all tables currently out there

# if you want to see the contents of the table just use a simple query like:
SELECT * FROM TABLE_NAME

#insert stuff into the table:
INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME VALUES ('insert http/https link here')

sounds simple enough ;)
